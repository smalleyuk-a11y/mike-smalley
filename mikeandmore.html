            <p class="case-study-summary">
                Milk & More is a leading UK grocery box delivery service. This project was part of a larger redesign of their mobile app. Having already built the app’s design system, my focus for this phase was to improve the order flow — reducing friction and making it clearer for users to place either repeat or one-off orders.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The existing order flow was confusing and inefficient, causing errors and frustrating users. 
                Key problems included poor differentiation between repeating and one-off orders, a slow product 
                selection process, and a lack of control over subscription management (like pausing deliveries).

        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Research & Insights</h2>
            <p>
                I reviewed existing user personas and data, which highlighted confusion between the two ordering methods. 
                Busy users found the multi-step “Add to Basket” process too slow, and excessive explanatory text 
                made the experience feel overwhelming. A review of the current sign-up and checkout flow also 
                revealed missing features such as the ability to edit orders and unclear visual feedback during key actions.

            <h2 class="section-title">Ideation & Strategy</h2>
            <p>
                It became clear that the core issue was communication — users didn’t understand the difference between the two order types. 
				Through the user flow i made sure the distinction was clear and well labled as you can see in the example attached. I also change the select options for the data selection to a calender as i sucpected having a familar interface would help users select the data. Apart from this i add the pause functionality and clean up the ux, e.g. adding in native pickers where reuqired.
                From there, I created mid- to high-fidelity wireframes to visualise and refine the new flow before moving into UI design.

            <h2 class="section-title">Design & Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Using the design system I had previously developed, I created a polished UI and interactive prototype of the improved order flow. 
                I introduced clearer visual hierarchy between recurring and one-time orders using consistent iconography and distinct color states. 
                The new summary screen also reduced uncertainty by displaying next delivery and payment details upfront.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to budget constraints, testing was conducted internally, but results showed strong usability — the majority of testers completed their orders without confusion or errors.
				
				The calender change show an far faster selection time.

            <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                The app’s rating improved from 4.1 to 4.3 on Google Play, with nearly 6,000 reviews. The customer support team reported fewer order-related queries and errors. 
                Stakeholders noted clearer communication between order types and smoother overall flow.
