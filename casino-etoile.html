            <p class="case-study-summary">
             Casino Etoile is a premier online casino affiliate platform. The goal of this project was to redesign their core review page template to bridge the gap between high-quality editorial content and affiliate conversion, ensuring users felt confident enough to click through and sign up.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
            <p>
               The existing review pages were underperforming. Despite high traffic, conversion rates were stagnant. Users found the layout "too salesy," which damaged credibility, and the information architecture was cluttered—forcing users to hunt for the welcome offers and T&Cs. The challenge was to make the "Play Now" CTA prominent without compromising the site's integrity as a trusted reviewer.

        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Research & Insights</h2>
            <p>
       he discovery phase began by analyzing Hotjar scroll maps and Google Analytics to identify specific friction points where users were dropping off. The data revealed a significant "Skim Factor," showing that users were not reading the long-form reviews but were instead searching for specific data points like RTP, licensing, and bonus terms. I also identified a major trust gap; vital security information and licensing badges were buried at the bottom of the page. Additionally, the primary call-to-action suffered from "CTA blindness" because it lacked a clear visual hierarchy and consistent placement.

        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Ideation & Strategy</h2>
            <p>
I focused on building a modular, mobile-first template that prioritized scannability and established "Trust Above the Fold." The strategy centered on a high-impact Summary Card, designed to house the casino rating, the current welcome offer, and a primary CTA in a single viewable area upon landing. To establish immediate authority, I moved regulatory badges and security certifications to the top of the page. By establishing predictable UI patterns for all action buttons, I ensured that users would intuitively know how to proceed regardless of which specific casino they were researching.

        <section class="case-study-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Design & Testing</h2>
            <p>
   The design was validated through two rounds of unmoderated testing via Lyssna to ensure the new hierarchy met user expectations. During the first iteration, tests showed that users still struggled to find specific wagering requirements. In response, I introduced a Bonus Tooltip and a sticky mobile CTA that remained anchored as the user scrolled through the detailed review content. The second round of testing saw a 40% improvement in users successfully locating bonus information, with qualitative feedback describing the new layout as professional, clear, and transparent.

            <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
            <p>
               The new template proved to be both a commercial and UX success, delivering a 5% lift in affiliate conversions in the first quarter post-launch. User feedback indicated a marked increase in confidence regarding the reviews, and the modular system allowed the team to roll out the new design across over 100 partner pages with zero additional design overhead. This project confirmed that focusing on visible trust and consistent user flows can directly impact both user satisfaction and affiliate revenue.

            <h2 class="section-title">What I Learnt</h2>
            <p>
               Designing for a trust-sensitive industry like iGaming requires a "less is more" approach where clarity is prioritized over persuasion. I learned that subtle visual signals—such as generous white space, high-quality typography, and the honest disclosure of restrictive terms—are far more effective at driving long-term revenue than aggressive or cluttered UI elements.
